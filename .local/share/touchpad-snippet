# this is a snippet of the touchpad libinput driver
# basically, this would go in the file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf
# the only things that should be added are all of the options that I've added here
# otherwise, if the first part that goes before the options isn't in the file for some reason, you should just include it all
# you can also include this as its own file in the same directory (xorg.conf.d) as 30-touchpad.conf
# remember that if there's a synaptics driver file in xorg.conf.d which takes precedence over this file, you should either
# delete it, or rename it with a lower priority number (such as 40)
# go to the arch wiki for more information
